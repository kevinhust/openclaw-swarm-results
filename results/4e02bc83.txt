Here is a simple bash script to print "Hello, World!".

### The Script (`hello.sh`)

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Hello, World!"
```

### How to create and run it:

1.  **Create the file:**
    Open your terminal and create a file named `hello.sh` using a text editor like `nano` or `vim`:
    ```bash
    nano hello.sh
    ```

2.  **Paste the code:**
    Copy the code above and paste it into the file. Save and exit (in nano, press `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`).

3.  **Make it executable:**
    You need to give the script permission to run:
    ```bash
    chmod +x hello.sh
    ```

4.  **Run the script:**
    Execute it by typing:
    ```bash
    ./hello.sh
    ```
