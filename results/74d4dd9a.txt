Here is a simple "Hello, World!" function in Python:

```python
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, World!")

# To run the function, you need to call it:
say_hello()
```

**Explanation:**
1.  `def` defines the function named `say_hello`.
2.  `print("Hello, World!")` is the code that runs inside the function.
3.  `say_hello()` calls the function so it actually executes.
